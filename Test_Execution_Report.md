Additional checks

Recommendations
- Add ARIA labels for search and filter inputs to close accessibility quick pass.
- For JWT secret test: restart backend with BACKEND_JWT_SECRET set; verify old tokens invalid, new tokens valid.

Conclusion
- The application is ready for the MVP scope with all executed tests passing. Minor accessibility labeling remains as a recommended improvement.
